# Diabetes Diagnosis â€“ Data Exploration and Analysis

## Overview
Stage 1 of the COMP5310 project involves data profiling, cleaning, and exploratory analysis of the given dataset: Diabetes Diagnosis. The goal is to derive insights and prepare the data for predictive modelling in Stage 2.

## Dataset
- **Diabetes Diagnosis**: Patient health metrics for diabetes prediction.

## Project Structure
Each dataset is analysed through:
1. **Problem Definition**: Define a classification/regression problem and identify stakeholders.
2. **Data Description**: Inspect schema, data types, missing values, and categorical features.
3. **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Address data quality issues and prepare data for modelling.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyse selected features using visual and statistical methods.

## Code Structure
- Three Jupyter notebooks (one per dataset) with Markdown documentation.
- Each notebook ends with saving the cleaned dataset as a CSV file.

## How to Run
1. Unzip the code archive.
2. Open each notebook in Jupyter.
3. Run all cells sequentially.
4. Cleaned datasets will be saved automatically.

## Notes
- No predictive modelling in Stage 1.
- All analysis is self-contained and reproducible.
- Late submissions incur penalties as per unit policy.
